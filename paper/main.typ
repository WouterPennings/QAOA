    This paper presents an analysis of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) performance across various graph types, focusing on its application to the maxcut problem. Quantum computing, leveraging phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, offers potential advancements in solving complex computational problems more efficiently than classical methods. QAOA, a hybrid quantum algorithm, combines classical and quantum computational resources to approximate solutions to optimization problems. This study explores QAOA's effectiveness in both noiseless and noisy environments using a quantum computer simulator. The noiseless experiments involve varying graph sizes and connectivity levels, for realistic noisy quantum computing conditions experiments how different levels of noise impact its performance. Key parameters of QAOA, β, γ, and `P`, are optimized using the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method. The results indicate that QAOA performs well in identifying optimal or near-optimal max-cuts for smaller graphs but faces challenges as graph size increases. Noise significantly impacts QAOA's performance, although it still outperforms random selection methods. The study highlights the need for further research to optimize QAOA parameters and explore its scalability and robustness in practical applications. The findings highlight QAOA's potential for approximating solutions to optimization problems on small-scale graphs, while also underscoring challenges related to scalability and performance consistency in the presence of quantum noise. Limitations include the limited diversity of graphs tested, particularly in noisy experiments, and the fixed `P` parameter, suggesting avenues for future research. This study contributes valuable practical insights into QAOA's behavior, addressing a gap in comprehensive experimental analysis of quantum algorithms.

= Introduction <sec:introduction>
In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising field with the potential to revolutionize the way complex computational problems in fields such as medicine, material science and machine learning are approached @hastings_improving_2014 @svore_quantum_2016. Various algorithms have gotton attention for their theoratical ability to solve problems more efficiently than their classical peers; Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm is one of them. To understand this paper, it is important to grasp two key quantum phenomena: superposition and entanglement. Superposition allows a quantum bit (qubit) to exist in a both the 0 and 1 state simultaneously until it is measured, at which point it collapses into a single definite state @yanofsky_introduction_2007 @prashant_study_2007, this mechanic is represented by a Hadamard (H) gate. Entanglement, on the other hand, describes a peculiar connection between two or more qubits where their states are intertwined, meaning the state of one qubit influences the state of another @yanofsky_introduction_2007 @prashant_study_2007, this mechanic is represented by a controlled-not (CNOT) gate.

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum algorithm designed to accurately approximate optimization problems. A hybrid quantum algorithm, means it combines both classical and quantum computational resources, leveraging the strengths of each to solve complex problems @campos_hybrid_2024. This exploration uses QAOA to address the max-cut problem. Max-cut is a graph problem where the goal is to divide the nodes into two groups so that the number of cut edges connecting the different groups is as large as possible. In this paper uses the varient where all edges have the same weight. With QAOA, each node in the graph is represented by a qubit, which is put into a superposition state using a Hadamard (H) gate. The edges connecting these nodes are represented by entangling the corresponding qubits, using either a ZZ-gate or a sequence of CNOT-RZ-CNOT gates.

QAOA has three key parameters: β, γ, and p. The parameter p sets the depth of the circuit, essentially dictating how many layers of operations are applied. The parameters β and γ are the angles that are classically optimized to find the best possible solution to our problem. The β angles are used in the mixing layer, also known as the mixing Hamiltonian, where they control the mixing of quantum states by rotating qubits around the X-axis. This process helps explore different configurations of the solution space. On the other hand, the γ angles are applied in the cost layer, or the cost Hamiltonian, where they adjust the rotations, guiding the solution towards an optimal outcome. The implementation used in this paper draws on the approach detailed in Farhi et al. @farhi_quantum_2014, ensuring that the study builds on established methods while exploring new insights.

The objective of this study is to explore the behavior of QAOA across a range of graph types. The generation of the graphs is achieved by altering two parameters: the number of nodes and connectivity. A quantum computer simulator is used to run the experiments, this is done for two main reasons. Firstly, this is much more approachable than using an actual quantum computer. Secondly, simulation allows for functionality that actual quantum computers do not have, mainly being able to determine the amount of noise. The majority of experiments are conducted in a noise-less environment; however, several experiments are also conducted with noise to study its impact. There is a lack of comprehensive studies that explore the practical application of QAOA, and this paper aims to address this gap. In quantum computing research, algorithms are often proposed without sufficient experimentation to understand how well they work in practice, this study seeks to provide valuable insights in this regard.

= Methodology <sec:methodology>
The objective of this study is to understand how the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) behaves when solving the max-cut problem across various graphs in both ideal and noisy environments.

Two types of experiments are conducted. The first type, noisy experiments, aims to understand how noise impacts QAOA's effectiveness. This is achieved by applying increasing levels of noise to a single graph until a realistic noise level is reached. The second type, noiseless or ideal experiments, investigates QAOA performance across different graphs, each with increasing numbers of nodes or edges.

For the ideal experiments, graphs consist of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 15 nodes with randomly generated edges. Each size category has two variants: low connectivity and high connectivity. Low connectivity implies a 40% chance of connection between nodes, while high connectivity implies an 80% chance. This results in a total of sixteen distinct graphs, all generated using NetworkX.

The noisy experiments utilize a single graph, referred to as the "house with a X" (@house_with_x). These experiments explore how increasing noise levels degrade QAOA's effectiveness. The noise levels, implemented as `noise_factor`, considered are 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1. Baseline experiments include randomly selected max-cut instances and an ideal circuit simulation. The noise models are based on Di Bartolomeo et al.'s implementation @di_bartolomeo_noisy_2023, with parameters used from Qiskit Kyiv quantum computer. These parameters represent the single-qubit depolarizing error probability (`p`), amplitude damping time of a qubit in ns (`T1`) and the dephasing time ofa qubit in ns (`T2`). `P` is multiplied by `noise_factor` while `T1` and `T2` are divided by `noise_factor` as they are inversy proportional to `noise_factor`.

  caption: [Visualization of "house with a X"],
) <house_with_x>

Both ideal and noisy experiments employ the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) to optimize γ and β parameters, parameter `P` is fixed at five across all experiments. SPSA's parameters are set to default values except for iteration (set to 10), learning rate (0.2), learning rate decay (0.602), and perturbation magnitude (0.2). The initial guess used in this sudy of γ and β for all layers is 0.5. There are many optimizers available, such as COBYLA, however SPSA seems to perform well in context such as these @pellow-jarman_comparison_2021.

To evaluate and compare the performance of the experiments, several evaluation metrics are used. The metrics are the same for both type of experiments. The metrics are:
-	*mean_random*: The average cut size based on probabilities, assuming P is 0.
-	*mean*: The average cut size based on the statevector's probabilities.
-	*mean_top_10*: The average cut size of the top ten cuts with the highest probability.
-	*mean_top_5*: The average cut size of the top five cuts with the highest probability.
-	*mean_top_3*: The average cut size of the top three cuts with the highest probability.
-	*maxcut_qaoa*: The cut with the highest probability from QAOA.
-	*maxcut_bruteforce*: The actual max-cut of the graph determined through classical brute-force methods.

Average cut size is a weighted mean where the weights are based on the probabilities.

In the case of noisy experiments, the statevector probabilities are also shown, which indicate the deviation in results due to noise. These metrics help determine QAOA's performance effectiveness in solving the max-cut problem.

== QAOA implementation & measuring
The implementation used for the experiments in this paper and described below is based on Fahri et al @farhi_quantum_2014. The experiments are not run on actual hardware, but simulated using QuantumSim @kuijpers_2025, an educational quantum computer simulator developed at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. This paper uses a computationally improved version which allows for faster simulation and for more qubits to be simulated.

QAOA’s three main steps of this paper’s implementation (@qaoa_code) are described below. @qaoa_circuit provides a visualization of the circuit.
- *Step 1*: Creating quantum circuit: Initializing a quantum circuit, each qubit represents a node of the graph.
- *Step 2*: Circuit into superposition: Putting all qubits into superposition using a Hadamard (`H`) gate.
- *Step 3*: Construction layers of cost and mixer Hamiltonian: Applying a `ZZ` gate between two qubits, which entangles them, this is the cost Hamiltonian. Using CNOT-RZ-CNOT gates to simulate a `ZZ` gate . Applying a `RX` gate to each qubit, this is the mixer Hamiltonian, the β value of the `RX` gate is multiplied by two.

  caption: [The QAOA circuit was generated by Qiskit. Barriers are added before and after the cost layer to prevent Qiskit from rearranging them. The circuit has two layers, and both β and γ are `[1, 2]`. The graph is a basic triangle, it has three nodes, 1 is connected to 2 and 3, and 3 is also connected to 2.],
) <qaoa_circuit>


After these steps a QAOA circuit is created and can be measured to find the maxcut of a graph. We will be directly looking at the probabilities of the simulator instead of measuring the statevector thousands of times. Looking directly at the probabilities of the statevector is only possible in simulators. It does not change the results of the quantum circuit as with enough measurements the results would reflect the probabilities of the statevector anyway. It does make the simulation process faster as measuring a circuit 100.000 times does take a significant amount of time. In the case of a noisy circuit, the circuit is executed a 30 times, and a mean of the probabilities is taken. The probabilities of the noisy circuit are indeterministic, therefore, the probabilities can be quite different between executes; requiring several executes.

=== Probability plots

Probability plots illustrate the likelihood of each possible quantum state. The sum of all probabilities for a given plot is 1, with individual probabilities ranging from 0 to 1. These probabilities describe the chance that a specific state will be the outcome when a quantum circuit is measured.

The plots present results for various conditions:
- @data_noise_noiseless represents the probabilities for an ideal, noiseless circuit.
- @data_noise_0.001, @data_noise_0.005, @data_noise_0.01, @data_noise_0.05, @data_noise_0.1, @data_noise_0.5, and @data_noise_1 show the probabilities for each experiment at its specific noise factor.
- The black bar indicates the standard deviation.
- The red and yellow arrows mark the upper and lower bounds of each possible outcome, derived from 30 executions.

At the bottom of each probability plot, labels such as `|00111>` and `|10001>` are presented. These labels represent the measured quantum states of the qubits in Dirac notation. For illustrative purposes, the state `|00111>` can be decomposed as follows:
- Qubit 1 is in state 0 (Commenly noted as |0>)
- Qubit 2 is in state 0 (Commenly noted as |0>)
- Qubit 3 is in state 1 (Commenly noted as |1>)
- Qubit 4 is in state 1 (Commenly noted as |1>)
- Qubit 5 is in state 1 (Commenly noted as |1>)

In the context of this study, these qubit states define the partitioning of a graph's nodes into the two groups of the cut graph. Each qubit represends a specific node within the graph. The state `|00111>` signifies that the first and second nodes are assigned to group A, the third, fourth, and fifth nodes are assigned to group B. This allows calculation of the number of cut edges. @data_noise_noiseless shows that `|01100>` and `|10011>` are the two outcomes with the highest probability. Noiseless or ideal probabilities for maxcut are always symmetrical, `|01100>` and `|10011>` is identical the nodes are just put into the opposite group. Noisy quantum computers have a random component to them and are indeterministic. Therefore, the probability plots of the noisy experiments, E.G. @data_noise_0.01, is not symmetrical.

= Discussion

== Noisy experiments

The experiments conducted with noise present insights into how the QAOA performs in more realistic conditions. The noiseless experiment(@data_noise_noiseless) was the only one that found the exact maxcut of the graph. Its probability plot (Figure 4) showed confidence in the solution, with the quantum states `|01100>` and `|10011>` having the highest probabilities. In contrast, all noisy experiments resulted in a maxcut of 5, which is close to optimal but not the true maximum of 6.

The probability plots for noisy QAOA (@data_noise_0.001, @data_noise_0.005, @data_noise_0.01, @data_noise_0.05, @data_noise_0.1, @data_noise_0.5, and @data_noise_1) reveal large differences between executions, indicated by the wide standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. For example, the state `|01111>` in @data_noise_1 sometimes had a probability of 0 and sometimes over 0.2. This variability clearly shows the unpredictable nature of quantum circuits when noise is present.

Interestingly, the actual amount of noise did not consistently worsen the quality of the output. @qaoa_noise_graph even shows that the `Mean Top 10` metric improved as the noise factor increased, although, that is likely a coincidence. While `Mean Top 5` and `Mean Top 3` fluctuated, the `Mean` and `Mean Random` values remained consistently low. This suggests that the presence of any noise was more impactful than the specific level of noise; which is against expectations. Nevertheless, all metrics measured in the noisy experiments were still better than simply picking a solution randomly, as `Mean Random` was always the lowest value.

== Noiseless experiments

The performance of QAOA without noise is detailed in the graphs and tables (@qaoa_low_connectivity, @noiseless_low_results_table, @qaoa_high_connectivity, @noiseless_high_results_table). The high connectivity graph with 10 nodes was an exception, as its `Mean random` value was higher than other `Mean Top N` metrics. This particular case was excluded from the general observations.

Key findings from the noiseless experiments include:
- QAOA consistently outperforms random max-cut selections, even in scenarios where its performance is suboptimal.

- For both low and high connectivity graphs, QAOA found the most optimal maxcut for graphs with up to 7 nodes.

- For graphs with 8 nodes or more, QAOA's results often differed from the true maximum cut found by brute force, with the exception of the low connectivity graph with 10 nodes, where QAOA was effective.

- Simply calculating the mean of all probabilities did not accurately show QAOA's effectiveness. It was more useful to look at the average cut size of the top 10 (or fewer) solutions with the highest probabilities. This does indicate the the outcomes with the highest amount of cut edges are also the ones with the highest probabilities.

- As graphs grew larger, for both high and low connectivity, there was a trend where focusing on a smaller number of top solutions (`Mean Top N` with smaller N) did not always lead to a higher average cut size. This indicates that the best cuts are not always the most probable ones.

- QAOA's performance was not noticeably different  for low and high connectivity graphs.

Why `N=10` with high connectivity is such an outlier is not understood. Similarly, `N=8` for low connectivity is also an outlier as `Mean Top 5` an `Mean Top 3` are both lower than `Mean Top 10`, eventhough this is not the case for `N=9` and `N=10`. There is no existing literature on the inconsistant performance of QAOA.

In summary, these experiments indicate that QAOA provides a good approximation of the optimal Max-cut solution for small graph sizes, irrespective of connectivity levels. However, QAOA's effectiveness diminishes as graph sizes increase, while connectivity appears to have a limited impact.

== QAOA P Count

In this study, the p parameter for QAOA was set to a constant value of 5 for all experiments. QAOA showed its weakest performance with the largest graphs (15 nodes), and this trend was also seen with graphs of 9 and 10 nodes. Increasing the `P` parameter could potentially allow QAOA to perform more iterations, which might help it find a more effective max-cut solution. This idea might also apply to the noisy experiments. Due to the indeterministic nature of noisy quantum computers and simulations, more layers (a higher `P` value) might be needed to find an optimal approximation.
// TODO: THERE IS A PAPER WHICH TALKS ABOUT LARGER P SIZES BEING BETTER 

== Limitations
This study has several limitations:

// TODO: This is written very poorly
- *Graph diversity:* Only one type of graph was used for each experiment. QAOA can behave differently with various graphs, so averaging results from multiple graph types might have reduced the impact of unusual behaviors, which likely caused the outlier results for low connectivity graphs with 8 nodes and high connectivity graphs with 10 nodes.

// TODO: There is a source for this find it. It is in your note somewhere.
- *Real-world and common Graph Structures:* The paper did not explore how QAOA performs on real-life and common graph structures, like social networks, which have distinct features that might affect QAOA's performance.

- *Noisy experiment graph:* The noisy experiments used only one graph. As seen in the noiseless experiments, some graph sizes can be outliers, and the "house with X" graph used for noisy tests might also be such an outlier. 

- *Number of noisy experiment executions:* The noisy experiments involved 20 executions per experiment. Because results varied greatly between runs, a few skewed executions could heavily influence the outcome. More executions, around a hundred or more), would likely provide more consistent results, however further testing is needed.

- *Noise model and parameters:* This study used one approach to model noise in quantum computer simulations with a single set of parameters (Qiskit Kyiv). Exploring other noise implementations and/or different noise parameters could lead to very different results.

- *Optimizer configuration:* The SPSA optimization function, used to find the best beta and gamma values, might not be ideally set up to find optimal values in a noisy quantum computer environment

== Conceptual problem: Parameter selection

The strategy of optimizing QAOA parameters individually for each graph raises a conceptual
concern: using a classical optimizer, such as COBYLA, to determine parameters that yield a good maxcut solution effectively involves solving the problem in advance. This introduces an apparent circularity to the approach. The process involves sampling a large set of parameter combinations and selecting those that yield favorable results. However, this raises a concern: if the goal is simply to identify high-quality solutions through classical optimization, would it not be more efficient to use a classical heuristic, such as simulated annealing, to solve MaxCut directly? 

A common response to this concern might be that exploring a wide range of QAOA parameters and selecting the best-performing configurations is ultimately more effective or computationally
efficient than relying on purely classical heuristics; particularly as quantum hardware improves. Nonetheless, this highlights an area where further research is needed. QAOA, and quantum computing more broadly, remains largely theoretical and is still far from practical deployment for real-world problems. It would be especially interesting to investigate whether a set of "universal parameters" could be found that perform reasonably well across many graph instances, even if not optimally for each one. 

Alternatively, future work could explore whether good parameter choices can be heuristically "guessed" based on structural properties of the graph, such as its size, degree distribution, or symmetry. Such approaches could help mitigate the inefficiencies and circularity of instance-specific optimization, potentially making QAOA a more scalable and practical algorithm.

= Conclusion

This paper investigated the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in solving the maxcut problem across various graph types and under both ideal or noiseless and simulated noisy conditions. The study aimed to understand QAOA's effectiveness, its scalability, and robustness in the presence of quantum noise.

In noiseless environments, QAOA consistently outperformed random selection for the maxcut problem on the graphs tested. For smaller graphs (up to 7 nodes), QAOA was effective, often finding the true maximum cut. As the graph size increased beyond 7 nodes, QAOA's ability to identify the exact max-cut diminished, regardless of graph connectivity. However, metrics like `Mean Top 10` still demonstrated that QAOA is relativally effective at approximating an optimal maxcut. But in general, these experiments demonstrate current limitation of QAOA's scalability for larger problem instances on ideal quantum computers.

The noisy experiments provided insights into QAOA's behavior in more realistic scenarios. While the noiseless QAOA experiment found the optimal maxcut, the noisy implementations consistently resulted in a near-optimal cut, showing a degradation from noiseless performance. A significant observation was the high variability in outcome probabilities in the presence of noise, highlighting the inherently indeterministic nature of noisy quantum computations. Surprisingly, for the specific graph and noise model used, an increase in the noise factor did not lead to a consistent decrease in performance for certain metrics like "Mean Top 10." Despite this, QAOA under noise still performed better than random selection, demonstrating its potential even when affected by errors. In general, noisy QAOA has, just like all quantum algorithms in practice, poor performance.

This research highlights that QAOA with current quantum technology, especially for smaller problems, has several challenges. The fixed `P` count in QAOA layers and the specific graph types used in this study present limitations that could influence the observed performance. Future work should explore a wider variety of graph structures, investigate the impact of optimizing the `P` parameter more effectively, and test different noise models and their parameters to gain a more comprehensive understanding of QAOA's capabilities and limitations in practical applications. Further research could also focus on developing more effective optimization strategies for QAOA parameters (γ and β) in noisy and ideal environments.
