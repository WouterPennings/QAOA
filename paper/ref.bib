	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising method of solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computing. QAOA on the MaxCut problem has been studied extensively on graphs with specific structure; however, little is known about the general performance of the algorithm on arbitrary graphs. In this paper, we investigate how different graph characteristics correlate with QAOA performance at depths at most three on the MaxCut problem for all connected non-isomorphic graphs with at most eight vertices. Some good predictors of QAOA success relate to graph symmetries, odd cycles, and density. For example, on eight vertex graphs, the average probability for selecting an optimal solution for graphs that contain no odd cycles after three iterations of QAOA is \$\$60.6{\textbackslash}\%\$\$compared to \$\$48.2{\textbackslash}\%\$\$for those that do. The data generated from these studies are shared in a publicly accessible database to serve as a benchmark for QAOA calculations and experiments. Knowing the relationship between structure and performance can be used to identify classes of combinatorial problems that are likely to exhibit a quantum advantage.},

	abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on an integer p ≥ 1 and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is ﬁxed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of eﬃcient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a diﬀerent strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for ﬁxed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always ﬁnds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

	abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising approach for programming a near-term gate-based hybrid quantum computer to find good approximate solutions of hard combinatorial problems. However, little is currently know about the capabilities of QAOA, or of the difficulty of the requisite parameters optimization. Here, we study the performance of QAOA on the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem, optimizing the quantum circuits on a classical computer using automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent, using QuantumFlow, a quantum circuit simulator implemented with TensorFlow. We find that we can amortize the training cost by optimizing on batches of problems instances; that QAOA can exceed the performance of the classical polynomial time Goemans-Williamson algorithm with modest circuit depth, and that performance with fixed circuit depth is insensitive to problem size. Moreover, MaxCut QAOA can be efficiently implemented on a gate-based quantum computer with limited qubit connectivity, using a qubit swap network. These observations support the prospects that QAOA will be an effective method for solving interesting problems on near-term quantum computers.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum mechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle introduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by motivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with simple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small fraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic quantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and quantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the simplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch's algorithm. Our presentation demands neither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.},

We show how to modify the noiseless gate executed by the computer to include any Markovian noise, hence resulting in what we will call a noisy gate. We compare our method with the IBM qiskit simulator, and show that it follows more closely both the analytical solution of the Lindblad equation as well as the behavior of a real quantum computer, where we ran algorithms involving up to 18 qubits; as such, our protocol offers a more accurate simulator for NISQ devices. The method is flexible enough to potentially describe any noise, including non-Markovian ones. The noise simulator based on this work is available as a python package at the link, https://pypi.org/project/quantum-gates.},

First, we modify how Jordan-Wigner transformations are implemented to reduce their cost from linear or logarithmic in the number of orbitals to a constant. Our modification does not require additional ancilla qubits. Then, we demonstrate how many operations can be parallelized, leading to a further linear decrease in the parallel depth of the circuit, at the cost of a small constant factor increase in number of qubits required. Thirdly, we modify the term order in the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, significantly reducing the error at given Trotter-Suzuki timestep. A final improvement modifies the Hamiltonian to reduce errors introduced by the non-zero Trotter-Suzuki timestep. All of these techniques are validated using numerical simulation and detailed gate counts are given for realistic molecules.},

Two approaches are studied: a hybrid search and sample optimization algorithm and a classical algorithm that assesses the cost and performance of quantum algorithms in chemistry. Hybrid algorithms are vital due to limitations in both classical and quantum computing, offering a solution by leveraging the strengths of both. The first algorithm, quantum Metropolis Solver (QMS), adapts a quantum walk to a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for industrial applications, demonstrating advantages over classical counterparts in various sectors. The second algorithm, TFermion, is a classical tool for evaluating the cost of T-type gates in quantum chemistry algorithms, aiding in the comparison and execution of these algorithms on real quantum hardware, and applied to the design of more efficient electric batteries.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08682v1},
	abstract = {Variational Hybrid Quantum Classical Algorithms (VHQCAs) are a class of quantum algorithms intended to run on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These algorithms employ a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) and a quantum-classical feedback loop. A classical device is used to optimize the parameters in order to minimize a cost function that can be computed far more efficiently on a quantum device. The cost function is constructed such that finding the ansatz parameters that minimize its value, solves some problem of interest. We focus specifically on the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), and examine the effect of several gradient-free and gradient-based classical optimizers on performance. We focus on both the average rate of convergence of the classical optimizers studied, as well as the distribution of their average termination cost values, and how these are affected by noise. Our work demonstrates that realistic noise levels on NISQ devices present a challenge to the optimization process. All classical optimizers appear to be very negatively affected by the presence of realistic noise. If noise levels are significantly improved, there may be a good reason for preferring gradient-based methods in the future, which performed better than the gradient-free methods with the only shot-noise present. The gradient-free optimizers, Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) and Powell's method, and the gradient-based optimizers, AMSGrad and BFGS performed the best in the noisy simulation, and appear to be less affected by noise than the rest of the methods. SPSA appears to be the best performing method. COBYLA, Nelder-Mead and Conjugate-Gradient methods appear to be the most heavily affected by noise, with even slight noise levels significantly impacting their performance.},
